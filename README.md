# Ask Chat GPT: Create an example curriculum using the following ideas.
# This is a project to build a web application

I have a few ideas in mind listed below:

After completing The Odin Project and the CS50x, complete the following:
1. Build a profitable educational web application that teaches life skills using math to kids (not grade-locked) already familiar with basic math operations. Make it clean and simple. Concepts should be applicable to practical situations. Most important of all, make it differentiable from other web applications like Khan Academy, Koobits, Practicle, etc. Suggesting pricing: 1 month free trial, $3/month, $20/year.

2. Perform a market analysis and ask to create an example product using ChatGPT. Ask to perform market segmentation, target marketing and value propositioning. Create a unique selling position to separate the web application from the apps already available. 

3. Introduce basic math operations, then word problems. Leading to equations to make introduction to use cases digestible. Create projects for each use cases to show understanding of concepts. Resources for basic math: Mathematics for the Practical Man (Harvard College). The basic math operations should at least be repetitive and then have time-pressured activities for memory enhancement and synthesis of future use cases.

4. Ideas to make the product differentiable and provide use cases to:
    a. Household chores to encourage helping in the family. This could be household budget, grocery inventory, price comparisons, etc.
    b. Financial literacy by teaching about investments, retirements, taxes, etc. Live investing by getting cash points when finishing levels. Invest depending on interest rates. Can withdraw but is subject to taxes and fees applicable to real world. Cash can be used to unlock game items or rewards. 
    c. Cybersecurity such as converting bits and hexadecimals.
    d. Health. Weight loss.
    e. Government policy such as population data, census data, etc.
    f. Physics (physical world) such as gravity and weight, trajectory, etc.
    g. English language.
    h. Traffic management and efficiency (i.e. is it worth taking a longer route but saves time or shorter route but longer time?)
    i. Electrical (I = VR). Electrical designs on homes. Electrical loads on outlets. Electrical loads when extensions are added. Common electrical loads of basic household appliances. How to calculate solar power + battery + grid and how they flow together. How to save money with solar. Battery efficiency. Battery in remote controls, household appliances, etc. Series vs parallel design on both.
    j. Plumbing.
    k. Construction. Geometry. Measurement of tools. Angles. Trigonometry. Structural loads. 
    l. Loans. Amortization of loans.
    m. Credit. Line of credit. Credit card. Budget. Interest rate.
    n. Plants. Hours of sun. Concept of time.
    o. Ratio and proportions.
    p. Business problems. Build a small or corporate business project. Employee salary, utilities, taxes, etc.

5. Possible features to include (free 1 month):
    a. Squid games theme were the symbols are operators instead of shapes. 
    b. Support the site with youtube tutorials. 
    c. Use AI tools to voice-over tutorials.
    d. Use LLM to generate word problems for each use case.
    e. Accessibility features for color blindednes, impaire visibility, hearing, cognitive, etc.
    f. Homework dashboard.
    g. Timed-test.
    h. Random testing.
    i. Data analytics/dashboard comparing students to others. Leaderboards.
    j. Family plan.
    k. Exams: Weekly, quarterly, annual.
    l. Worksheets per operation. Homework, activity, exams, quiz, etc. Good for teachers too.
    m. Send weekly progress through email and other relevant info.

6. Think about future scaling.

7. Follow cybersecurity guidelines. CWE practices. Caldera (MITRE). Pass on authentication, payments, to secure third party services and just make the app.

8. Tools. Do some YouTube research.
    a. Use animaker (https://app.animaker.com/dashboard) for videos. Flexbox zombie is also a good concept for static storyboard.
    b. Login. Firebase. auth0.com
    c. Payment. Authorize.net. Stripe. 
    d. Hosting. VPS Hosting. Digital Ocean. Google Cloud. Heroku.

9. Create a brand equity. Like coke vs pepsi. Everyone likes coke when blind test says pepsi tastes better than coke. But coke has more brand equity so everyone prefers coke even without tasting both. xcc
